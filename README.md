Run with your linux user-name set as the `MY_LINUX_USER` variable.

You can also disable conda, keras and theano-installation by passing `CONDA="InputAnything"`

## Example usage
`sudo MY_LINUX_USER="NegatioN" bash install_cuda.sh`

PS: Nvidia repositories can be really slow, so be patient. At least they were for me.
